# Program-to-implement-Context-Free-Language


**ABSTRACT**

This report contains the detailed description of our program. The program talks about
how Context free languages can be implemented through a programming language, in
this case; JavaScript.

In order to understand the concept of how context free language can be implemented
through a programming language, it is important for us to analyze what a context free
grammar is.

A context-free grammar (CFG) consisting of a finite set of grammar rules is a
quadruple ​ **(N, T, P, S)** ​ where

```
● N ​ is a set of non-terminal symbols.
● T ​ is a set of terminals where ​ N ∩ T = NULL.
● P ​ is a set of rules, ​ P: N → (N ∪ T)* ​, i.e., the left-hand side of the production
rule ​ P ​ does have any right context or left context.
● S ​ is the start symbol.
```
**Example**

```
● The grammar ({A}, {a, b, c}, P, A), P : A → aA, A → abc.
● The grammar ({S, a, b}, {a, b}, P, S), P: S → aSa, S → bSb, S → ε
● The grammar ({S, F}, {0, 1}, P, S), P: S → 00S | 11F, F → 00F | ε
```
The code enclosed in this report gives a brief yet efficient implementation of the
Context Free Language in JavaScript

**INTRODUCTION**

Context-free languages (CFLs) are generated by context-free grammars. The set of all
context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown
automata, and the set of regular languages is a subset of context-free languages. An
inputed language is accepted by a computational model if it runs through the model
and ends in an accepting final state.
The important thing to remember is that all regular languages are context-free
languages, but not all context-free languages are regular. Most arithmetic expressions
are generated by context-free grammars, and are therefore, context-free languages.
Context-free languages and context-free grammars have applications in computer
science and linguistics such as natural language processing and computer language
design.
We have come up with a JavaScript program to implement Context Free Languages.




**CONTEXT FREE GRAMMAR**

A Context-free Grammar is a collection of four objects:
● A set of nonterminal symbols (also called variables),
● A set of terminal symbols (the alphabet of the CFG),
● A set of production rules saying how each nonterminal can be converted by a
string of terminals and nonterminals, and
● A start symbol (which must be a nonterminal) that begins the derivation.

In context-free grammar (CFG), every production rule is of the form of
A → α
where A is a single nonterminal symbol, and α is a string of terminals and/or
nonterminals (α can be empty).

Context-free grammar rules may have any (possibly empty) sequence of symbols on
the right-hand side. Because the rule format is more flexible than it is for regular
grammars, the rules are more powerful.

The name for these grammars, “context-free,” makes sense because, using these rules,
the decision to replace a nonterminal by some other sequence is made without looking
at the context in which the nonterminal occurs.

All of the following are allowable context-free grammar rules (assuming appropriate
alphabets):
● S → aSb
● S →
● T → T
● S → aSbbTT
The following are not allowable context-free grammar rules:
● ST → aSb
● a → aSb
● ε → a



**CONTEXT FREE LANGUAGE**

A language that is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) is called a context-free
language (CFL).

Examples:

An example for context-free language is, L = {a​n​b​n​ : n ≥ 1}
L is generated by the CFG, S -> aSb | ab
It is accepted by the push-down automata M = ({q​ 0 ​q​ 1 ​q​f​},{a,b},{a,z},훿,q​ 0 ​,z,{q​f​})

A similar example is, L = {a​n​b​n : n ≥ 0}. A​n​B​n is not regular, but it is context-free
because it can be generated by the grammar G = ({S, a, b}, {a, b}, R, S), where:
R = { S → aSb
S → ε }.

Balanced Parentheses Language is also a context-free language.
Consider L = {w ​ε {), (}* : the parentheses are balanced}. It is context-free because it
can be generated by the grammar G = ({S, ), (}, {), (}, R, S), where:
R = { S → (S)
S → SS
S → ε }.
Some example derivations in G:
S ⇒ (S) ⇒ ().
S ⇒ (S) ⇒ (SS) ⇒ ((S)S) ⇒ (()S) ⇒ (()(S)) ⇒ (()()).
So, S ⇒ *() and S⇒ *(()()).



**LANGUAGE USED - JAVASCRIPT**

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and
multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
object-orientation, and first-class functions.

JavaScript is a simple and easy-to-learn programming language as compared to other
languages such as C++, Ruby, and Python.

JavaScript is a widely used language on all the devices.

JavaScript can be used for various purposes all the way from user-end browser
scripting (including various frameworks such as ReactJS, React Native for mobile
devices, AngularJS, VueJS), to server side scripting (using NodeJS, Express and such
applications and frameworks).

Our application here runs on the user-end using vanilla JS (pure JavaScript) on the
VScode environment.




**CODE IN JAVASCRIPT**

var​ ​rules​ = {
​"S"​:​ [
[​"The"​, ​"N"​, ​"V"​]
],
​"N"​:​ [
[​"cat"​],
[​"dog"​] ],
​"V"​:​ [
[​"meows"​],
[​"barks"​] ]
};
function​ ​expand​(​start​, ​expansion​) {
​if​ (​rules​[​start​]) {
​var​ ​pick​ = ​random​(​rules​[​start​]);
​console​.​log​(​pick​);
​for​ (​var​ ​i​ = ​ 0 ​; ​i​ < ​pick​.​length​; ​i​++) {
​expand​(​pick​[​i​], ​expansion​);
}
} ​else​ {
​expansion​.​push​(​start​);
}
​return​ ​expansion​.​join​(​' '​);
}
var​ ​button​;
function​ ​setup​() {
​noCanvas​();
​button​ = ​createButton​(​'generate'​);
​button​.​mousePressed​(​cfg​);
}
function​ ​cfg​() {
​var​ ​start​ = ​'S'​;
​var​ ​expansion​ = [];
​var​ ​result​ = ​expand​(​start​, ​expansion​);
​console​.​log​(​result​);
​createP​(​result​);
}


**IMPLEMENTATION**

● The implementation of the above code starts from the function cfg which will
start off with initializing the value of variable start to ‘S’, which is the
dictionary in which the rules of the Context-free grammar has been defined.
● Also variable expression has been initialized to an empty array. This is the
variable in which the context-free language that has been developed will be
stored over the course of the implementation of the program.
● After the above the variables have been initialized, function expand is called
within the same function to carry out the expansion.
● So, first the start variable is passed to through the if -else statement. Then to
select the replacement element it is passed through the for loop in which the
one of them is picked and will be later on pushed onto the array expression.
● Similarly, all the words will be replaced to get a final statement which will be
returned to the function called in the function cfg.
● The value returned will be stored in the variable result, the same will be printed
out on the screen.




**EXAMPLE USED IN THE CODE**

● The grammar G = ({S, N, V}, {cat, dog, meows, barks}, R, S), where:
R = { S → TheNV
N → CatDog
V → MeowsBarks }.

● The above is the way the rules of the language are being defined in the
program.

```
● So we can see in the above example how the replacement is being
carried out.
```

**OUTPUT**


**CONCLUSION**

Through this group activity, we understood the concept of Context Free Grammars
and Context Free Languages. This activity helped us in practically implementing the
theoretical knowledge we learnt during the class hours.
We were able to implement what we learnt and also improved our coding skills by
first identifying the requirements and then coding the same. The applications of
Context free Languages are wide and the scope for us to expand our knowledge is
huge. We would like thank Prof. Bhavya G for giving us this opportunity to take up
this activity.
